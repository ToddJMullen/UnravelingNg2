# UnravelingNg2
This is a git repo created as I have been working through Unraveling Angular 2.

The initial repo was deleted when I realized I had forgotten to ignore the book's downloaded source code.

The sources here will deviate from the book for reasons of experimentation and the fact that I don't like the "do a,b,c, clone it all, do d,e, clone it all, do f..." approach.  I will merge the various topics into one app in the best way that I can think to do it at the time if & when it may change direction or motif.

The commit message will also deviate slightly from the norm in that I often add anecdotal information when experimenting in order to help reinforce information that I've teased out.

Chapter 1 (My01-03/) development was done exclusively in Visual Studio Code Build, start, run, & misc. Git commands were executed in both the in-app CLI & Linux CLI
Git commits were executed using both the VSC Source Control features & Linux CLI.
