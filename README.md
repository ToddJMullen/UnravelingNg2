# UnravelingNg2
This is a git repo created as I have been working through Unraveling Angular 2.

The initial repo was deleted when I realized I had forgotten to ignore the book's downloaded source code.

The commit message will also deviate from the norm in that I often add anecdotal information when experimenting in order to help reinforce information that I've teased out & explain to myself (and others) what I was doing or experienced.

The sources here will deviate from the book for reasons of experimentation and the fact that I don't like the "do a,b,c, clone it all, do d,e, clone it all, do f..." approach.  I will merge the various topics into one app in the best way that I can think to do it at the time if & when it may change direction or motif.

Chapter 1 (My01-03/) development was done exclusively in Visual Studio Code Build, start, run, & misc. Git commands were executed in both the in-app CLI & Linux CLI
Git commits were executed using both the VSC Source Control features & Linux CLI.

Chapter 2 (My02-01/) was done exclusively in Atom Win v1.20 and on Linux with v 1.17 (until today when I upgraded to v.1.20.1) I tried using the GitPlus plugin, but the key bindings are missing/conflicted and it required(es) too
much use of the mouse preferred the command line only (on Linux or GitBash/Windows).
